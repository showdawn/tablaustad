    comment: One of the best Gurus ever! A fantastic teacher who can teach according to the skill and level of the learner. Sir is a down-to-earth and very knowledgable gentleman, with superior ethics that are difficult to find nowadays. My child has been attending classes for more than 2 years now, and we are extremely grateful for the individual attention and caring support.

    comment: If you are looking for individual attention, SB Singh sir's Tabla class academy is the place for you. My son is taking Tabla classes under sir. Sir is very knowledgeable, humble, patient and loving to small kids. The best guidance we have ever received in Bangalore.

    comment: My son learns tabla from SB Singh sir for the last 10 months. He is an experienced tabla teacher with very good teaching techniques. I have seen him to be extremely patient with kids. My son has learnt the basics very quickly under him. Thanks to SB Singh sir and I recommend that other parents should also put their kids in his classes.
